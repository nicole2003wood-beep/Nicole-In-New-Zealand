        <p id="par1">So, I drove down to my new home. The drive was just over 3 hours, and I had a lovely time. The roads are less scary
            then I remember, and it was very fun to sing at top volume by myself in the car. Lots of Sabrina Carpenter on the radio atm 
            and she has some very catchy songs. I listened to a podcast, and then once I got in view of the mountains, I took a rest to eat and
            stretch. I don't remember the scenery being this beautiful before, it really is all encompassing. It did rain the whole way so maybe 
            that made it feel more dramatic.

        <p id="par2">In the middle of the South Island and right next to the Southern Alps.
            The views are truly stunning, and I really hope I don't get used to this. The mountains are currently snowcapped, I have 
            been told that in the summer everything turns yellow. Day 2 was very sunny, I saw this gorgeous shaped cloud out the window.
