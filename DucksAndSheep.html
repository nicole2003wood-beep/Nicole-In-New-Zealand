        <p id="par1">Another fun week or so. I worked a full week and did manage to have 2 clear nights to see the stars as I am supposed
            to be seeing them. It was very beautiful, well worth the trip over here. Petting zoo had a llama and its baby.

        <p id="par2">Got some dinner by the lakeside. It was a burger but without the bun so they gave me extra lettuce. I am
            currently trying to decide whether to accept gluten or not, I may just have minimal amounts so that I don't 
            lose my gluten digesting enzyme. Anyway, this duck joined me whilst I was eating, and it didn't attack me but it
            did keep edging forwards so I had to keep shooing it back. Then a man came along and sat at the table and scared it away. 
            Very tasty food, will probably go back there.

        <p id="par3">On my day of I went to Oamaru to see the penguins! Did see them in their little nests and even one coming out of the 
            water. There were a few seals sunbathing and once again I think if I could be any animal it would be a seal. I also found out 
            that there used to be giant penguins, like almost human size, during the dinosaur era. I don't know if this was common knowledge 
            but I had never even thought of the possibility of giant penguin, they are really quite scary looking.

        <p id="par4">I also got to go to the Tekapo hot springs which was absolutely lovely. If I could go every day I think I would. I did 
            sauna for the first time, and the cold plunge, very theraputic. Unfortunatly one of the pools was under construction so the 
            view of the lake was blocked but I got in for free so was in no mind to complain.
